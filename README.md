## My process

### What I learned

  This is the first project I've completed using svg image files, and it was a good learning experience to figure out the ways in which they can be inserted into the code. I had a bit of a roadblock in the beginning when I couldn't get the svg background image to show up in Chrome, but it turned out to be a syntax error.

  I also got more practice with flexbox and when to use the different properties & values based on the page's design. I could definitely work on cleaning up/compacting my code, but I tried my best not to be redundant. Overall, I would say this challenge was a great way to brush up on my previous HTML & CSS knowledge, and I'm pretty pleased with the outcome.

### Useful resources

- [Using SVGs in CSS](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/use-svg-images-in-css-html/) - This was my favorite resource when figuring out how to use SVG files in my code.
- [Box-shadow property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) - This was used more as a refresher, but was still extremely helpful when styling my site.
